Solo project creating a full-stack News Application using Spring and React.

What does it do?: The application is intended to be used as an internal resource for a news company to manage articles and journalists.

What I got out of the project: Consolidated understanding of Java and JavaScript to create a full-stack web application.

What are you proud of in there: I'm proud of what I achieved in the given time-frame as my first attempt at a full-stack app.

What would you change about it: I will continue to work on the application as I would like to implement more advanced CSS/design elements as well as elevating the functionality and adding authentication and a log-in page.
